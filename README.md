AoT-Experiment: Atom of Thoughts for Markov LLM Test-Time Scaling
=================================================================

This project is an experiment in implementing the **Atom of Thoughts (AOT)** framework within a [T3](https://create.t3.gg/) Next.js application to explore **Markov-style reasoning** and **Test-Time Scaling** for Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to break down complex reasoning into atomic steps while leveraging efficient computation during inference.

üß† What is Atom of Thoughts (AOT)?
----------------------------------

The **Atom of Thoughts (Aot)**

(<https://huggingface.com/blog/aot> )(<https://www.zhihu.com/p/687504222> )(<https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/691052786> )

(<https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/692677238> ) is a novel reasoning framework that transforms complex reasoning tasks into a sequence of atomic questions, modeled as a **Markov process** . It introduces a two-phase mechanism:

1.  **Decomposition** : Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems.
2.  **Merging** : Combining results from each atomic step into a coherent final output.

Additionally, it models dependencies between sub-tasks using a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** to ensure logical flow and dependency tracking.
